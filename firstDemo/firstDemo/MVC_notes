MVC Design Pattern:-
 
model - plain java bean/pojo class that stores that like Employee, Account, Book etc
         --to hold member data along with member functions 

view - jsp / html pages - take i/p or show output
 
controller - JEE API- servlet class, Spring framework (any class annotated with @Controller)

        Front Controller - responsible for deciding flow of your application
              -- request mapping - map to which controller? which method? 

        Business Controllers like EmpController, LoginController etc
             -- business methods related that controller
                   -- modify data of model classes in some wat

        controller will select the view to show final model data
